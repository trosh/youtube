youtube-cli
===========

Search and play tracks, videos and playlists from YouTube

Depends on `youtube-dl` and `mplayer`

Reuses previous search results if query hasn't changed

Two tools are provided:

* `yt` searches for videos or playlists

  Arguments are coalesced into the search query.

  The output is human readable if output is a tty,
  otherwise the webpage URLs are returned.

* `yu` transforms video/playlist URLs into the corresponding stream URLs

  It takes a single positional argument:
  a pattern describing which lines from its input to use
  (`-` to describe a range, `,` to separate values or ranges),
  and whether to fetch video or audio stream for each
  (add `a` or `v` after a single value or continuous range).
  Playlist URLs play its first 10 elements by default
  but a subpattern (`plist`) can be used to specify which elements
  to play.

  The default media type is audio, unless explicitely overridden
  with optional argument `-a` or `-v`.

  Output is a list of stream URLs which can be given to a media player.
